          <h1>Bio</h1>
          <p>Hi! I’m Jordan Oleson-Graves. I’m an artist and designer based in Atlanta, making work with code across all kinds of media, including jewelry, textiles, and interactive installations.
            I started my creative path at SCAD, earning a BFA in Motion Media Design. I originally thought I’d go on to design commercials and movie title sequences. That changed when I took a history of motion graphics class and discovered wonderful world of abstract animation. I realized I cared less about getting a commercial job and more about experimenting and making art. Along the way I explored fibers and physical making but didn’t yet have the tools to create what I wanted. After graduating, I felt lost and stuck until I started designing 3D printed jewelry. Building that business gave me the freedom and space to experiment without worrying about success.</p>

<div class="info reveal  active" style="width:100%">
<p>That’s when I finally had time to learn how to code. It was slow at first with lots of failed experiments but eventually I started making the work I had imagined for years, from large LED installations to code-generated knitwear. I went on to earn an MS in Digital Media from Georgia Tech, where my research explored the relationship between crafting and computer science education, digital fabrication, and creative social interactions. Because coding changed my creative life, I now spend a lot of time teaching high school computer science so I can help students discover their own ideas and make them real. I’m currently pursuing my MFA in Painting at SCAD.

          <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
          <p style="">Curiosity drives my work. I grew up witnessing the shift from analog to digital technology, a transformation that abstracted previously visible processes into seamless interfaces. Old Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) displays revealed their mechanics, you could view closely and see the individual red, green, and blue components blending into color. That tangibility has been lost in contemporary digital displays, making the underlying structure is hidden. Early in my career in Motion Graphics, my work shifted and aimed to make the digital tangible again, not by mimicking the screen but by redefining its logic through material and form. While my work always begins digitally, its final form incorporates materials including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), fibers, 3D-printed jewelry, and recently motors to create kinetic work. 
            <br><br>In my LED installations, I retain the fundamental building block of the individual pixel but break from the rigid rectangular grid of traditional digital displays. Instead, I arrange the pixels along undulating waves and in concentric circles, creating an alternative canvas to design animations with these new forms in mind. In my knitted works, each stitch represents a pixel. The process of knitting imposes the same qualities needed of early internet graphics. Graphics Interchange Format images (GIFs) use limited color palettes and pixel dimensions to reduce file size for faster transmission. My kinetic sculptures, like GIFs, produce looping animations. 
            <br><br>Parametric design and algorithm development allow me to navigate the uncertainty of the blank page and the process of starting something new. I begin with a basic grid structure, then incrementally introduce complexity, shaping the final form by modifying the values of each variable. This process mirrors the hands-on refinement of a ceramicist working on a wheel, slight adjustments that transform the final form. Working in this way produces countless variations that I curate and select to transform into physical materials. 
            <br><br> Printmaking is another way I explore variation within structured systems. Just as an algorithm can generate limitless iterations, printmaking allows me to discover these variations through layering multiple impressions and experimenting with linear and rotational offsets. 
            <br><br>My work resists the fleeting nature of screen-based imagery by bringing digital aesthetics into the physical world. Through light, movement, print, and textiles, I reimagine the structured logic of digital systems as something more fluid and organic. Whether replacing pixels with stitches, rearranging LED grids into waves and spirals, or using printmaking to generate variations from a single form, I embrace constraints to give digital aesthetics a physical presence.
